# Predicting Covid Cases in Malaysia using AI
 
## Design Decision
This laboratory report's design decision tries to anticipate the daily total number of deaths caused by COVID19. The goal of the study is to determine the number of deaths or death rate, particularly when a new epidemic wave or variant emerges. Also, to determine the relationship between vaccination status and death number. Therefore, supervised learning aids in predicting the future death rate due to COVID19, allowing the government to instantly plan for solution to aid in reducing the death number. The selected calendar range is between January 2021 and June 2021. The graph below depicts a line chart of new death cases per day in Malaysia during the epidemic.
